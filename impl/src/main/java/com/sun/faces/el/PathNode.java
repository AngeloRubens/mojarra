/**
 * Evaluates <code>name</code> or <code>name.property.property...</code> the way the EL interpreter does:
 * <ol>
 * <li>the name is a variable captured from the variable mapper when the expression was created, whose expression is
 * evaluated, or else it is resolved by the resolver chain with no base;
 * <li>each property is resolved by the resolver chain on the previous value, until a value is <code>null</code>.
 * </ol>
 * In addition, when the Faces chain would resolve a property with the BeanELResolver, the getter is called directly,
 * with an inline cache of the reader for the last base class seen. A getter that throws is called once more through
 * the BeanELResolver, so that its exception is wrapped exactly as the resolver wraps it.
